# MATLAB Empty Array Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to empty array returns from functions.  The issue arises from implicit type conversion and a lack of explicit checks for empty arrays, potentially leading to unexpected program behavior and errors.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction` function in `bug.m` returns an empty array in certain conditions. The main problem arises when the calling code doesn't explicitly handle this empty array return, causing unexpected consequences if the calling code assumes a non-empty result.

## Solution
The solution (`bugSolution.m`) explicitly checks for the empty array using `isempty()` before proceeding with further calculations involving the returned value. This ensures robust error handling and prevents unexpected behavior.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `bug.m`.
4. Observe the unexpected output if the condition causing the empty array result is met.
5. Run `bugSolution.m`. Observe that it provides better handling for the empty array case.
